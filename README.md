# Skeleton Party
Skeleton Party is a beat-em-up, action RPG that can be played right in your browser window (_Chrome recommended_).

Originally developed by myself, [Brandon Morris](https://github.com/bbMorris) & [Jeremy Manandic](https://github.com/JeremyJan) for a university project. This repository is a public mirror of the original project in order to showcase the code base, and is currently maintained and updated solely by myself.
